I plan to build a network-scanning detection framework to evaluate how effectively AI agents can operate within a monitored network environment. Leveraging my experience in developing NDR detections and my background in network security, I will design a concise evaluation for OpenAI (and, time permitting, Gemini) to assess how capable these models are at generating attacker tooling that can evade detection in a well-maintained network.
